# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- master
- develop
- feature/*

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- script: |
    echo "triggered by dev"
    echo $(Build.SourceBranch)
  displayName: 'Run a one-line script'
  condition: eq(variables['build.sourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/develop')

- script: |
    echo "triggered by master"
    echo $(Build.SourceBranch)
